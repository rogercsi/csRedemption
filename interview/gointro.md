## Learn a new programming language
when you first come into a new programming language, things are difficult, because everything is so unfamiliar to you. It is a common situation for everyone, so what is the basic procedure to deal with the panic?

1. learn baisc grammer
> not just watch the grammer, do the code, familiar yourself with the basic grammer by dealing with leetcode problem, just watch seldom helps

2. learn the build process
> high level programming language code will finally be translated to machine code, if you want to run your code, you will need to know how this process goes

3. learn the language design philosophy
> programming language differs a lot. If you want your code to run safe and fast, you need to learn how your code will be executed in machine level code. Since it is rather hard to delve into the machine code level, at least you need to know some abstract design concepts and philosophy of the language

4. learn some distinct concept in the language
> like `类型嵌入（Type Embedding）`  `type alias`

5. learn what a basic go program will be like, how to structure your code files


**more about build process**
> type `go env` in cmd to learn the configs of go compiler
> learn how to use `go module` to build your project
